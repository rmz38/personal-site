#### Intro
Hi, my name is Rose. I’m a junior at Cornell University. I believe that most problems can be solved with software and I love to think of those solutions! This past summer I created a website for a local nonprofit as an intern at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, and I also work part time at Cornell’s Asia Library Collection by maintaining their website. Outside of work, I also contribute to CoursePlan, a 4-year course planning app, developed by the project team Cornell Design & Tech Initiative. While I love problem solving, I also enjoy playing competitive video games with my friends. Introducing others to gaming is important to me as well, and I host tournaments and game nights as president of eSports at Cornell, a student organization that promotes competitive gaming for everyone. If you'd like to learn more about these projects, check out my [resume](/resume)

#### Some history

- I loved playing games since I was 5 years old, I had a Game Boy Advanced with Pokemon, Kirby, and Mario games on it!

- When I started using a desktop Windows Computer at 7, I played a lot of flash games online, plus interactive story book games like _The Tortoise and the Hare_ and _Goldilocks and the Three Bears_.

- At 8, my dad loved playing Age of Empires, solitaire, and minesweeper. I would sit next to him and watch him win games really fast. It made me think he was a genius.

- At 9, I started taking art lessons with our local middle school's art teacher, Faith Carapella, who was passionate about still life drawing. Under her guidance, I won first prize in the state Duck Stamp drawing contest for my age group.

- At 10, I repaired my family's iPods and radios with my dad, who enjoyed teaching me as well as saving money.

- At 11, I got a Nintendo DS and Wii for my birthday and played a lot of Just Dance!

- When I was 12, I loved playing the game Wizard101, and I climbed to the top 5% of the ranked PVP ladder.

- At 13, I drew a portrait of a friend, because I was too shy to draw myself. I submitted the drawing into the Scholastic Art competition and won a Gold Key, the highest honor. I'm grateful she helped me, and now I'm much more confident in myself!

- At 14, I saw a movie about hacking and became obsessed with becoming a hacker. So, I downloaded Cheat Engine and abused it on Club Penguin.

- At 15, I became more interested in learning to program, and took an Introduction to Computer Science course at my high school. I learned Java as my first programming language and made a Scratch game that was voted "Most Creative Game" by my classmates, which was a mashup between Flappy Bird and Angry Birds.

- Also at 15, I found a cheap RMC car and a birthday card that would scream when opened. Then, I attached the board of the car to the circuit of the birthday card, so that whenever a button was pressed on the remote the card would scream. I tested my project by taping it under a classroom chair and triggering it when a classmate sat down.

- At 16, I wanted to create more software projects and I was still interested in becoming a hacker. To this end, I used AutoHotkey to find a student's school account password. Due to every student's school account password being a 4-digit number, I had my program enter every number in 0-9999 inclusive to login into an account. Unfortunately it entered input on the webpage, which meant it could take up to 17 hours to enter every number and refresh the page.

- At 17, I enjoyed my AP Computer Science class and created one of my first, matured projects on it. It was a website that [colored in black and white images](/projects) by taking a given color and converting the values of the image matrix to shades of that color. Because of this project, my teacher encouraged me to study computer science in college.

- At 18, I enrolled in Cornell University's College of Engineering as a Computer Science major. Then, I joined as a club officer to the student organizations Association of Computer Science Undergraduates and eSports at Cornell. I found great mentors in these orgs who taught me professional skills and leadership!

- At 19, I studied abroad in Hong Kong, the same time the 2019 Hong Kong protests started. It was so much fun to sing karaoke and hike on nearby islands there! However, experiencing a significant part of history was the most memorable.

As I grow older, I'll come up with more stories to tell :)
